I am a high school student in my final year, majoring in programming and computer science.

I love low-level programming, cybersecurity-related stuff, and coffee. 

Currently, I am studying for HackTheBox CPTS certification. I am planning on doing OSCP soon.

I used to code a lot, but nowadays, I don't do it quite often. However, I am working on my own C compiler since I am deeply interested in how programming languages work.

I made this blog, so I can share stuff that I learn with people and also share the progress of different CTFs, but mostly to teach the stuff I learn so I solidify my knowledge. I don't think you should be learning from me, because there are probably better resources, and if there are I will share them at the beggining of each post.
